The peripheral index is the number TinyQV will use to select your peripheral.  You will pick a free
slot when raising the pull request against the main TinyQV repository, and can fill this in then.  You
also need to set this value as the PERIPHERAL_NUM in your test script.

# OFDM Offloader 

Author: Tarun Vignesh G and Shreya Ranjitha M

Peripheral index: nn

## What it does

The peripheral provides efficient symbol mapping for two common modulation schemes used in OFDM systems: QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) and 16-QAM(16-level Quadrature Amplitude Modulation).

Functional Description:

The peripheral accepts input bits from the CPU, groups them according to the selected modulation scheme, and produces corresponding I (in-phase) and Q (quadrature) symbol components.

Mapping is performed in hardware using lookup-table–style combinational logic for low latency.

A simple finite state machine (FSM) controls the flow:

IDLE: Waits for CPU start command.

MAP: Performs symbol mapping.

OUTPUT: Makes the I/Q output available to the CPU.

Modulation Schemes:

QPSK: Maps 2 input bits → 1 complex symbol (I/Q each ±1).

16-QAM: Maps 4 input bits → 1 complex symbol (I/Q each ∈ {–3, –1, +1, +3}).
